Statistical Analysis and Conclusions

# PyCity Schools Analysis

OVERALL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
This analysis highlights several key factors influencing student performance, including school size, type, curriculum and budget efficiency, presented as four major trends with conclusions and recommended improvements.
The statistics clearly show that charter school students perform significantly higher, especially in Mathematics, when compared to students attending district schools. Therefore, the flexibility and personalized approaches, especially to Mathematics education, implemented in charter schools, could serve as valuable models for improving district schools. Additionally, further research into enhancing the mathematics curriculum in district schools is essential.
The size data suggests that students might benefit from increased individualized attention. Student to teacher ratios, classroom sizes, as well as demographics, need to be measured and considered. Interestingly, Increased spending does not result in higher performance. Therefore, more attention should be paid to how funds are allocated in district schools. In addition to improving the curriculums, management, and staffing in these schools, spending is best directed towards opening new schools to release pressure off the existing ones.
 
CHARTER VS DISTRICT
TREND 1  
Charter schools significantly outperform district schools, especially in Mathematics. 
    ANALYSIS OF THE TOP 5 AND BASE 5 SCHOOLS
        .   The 5 top performing schools in terms of overall passing percentage ranging from 90.5% and 91.5% are all charter schools. 
        .   In contrast, the 5 base-performing schools of lower passing rates ranging from 52.98% to 53.53%.  are all district schools. 
    ANALYSIS OF THE SCORES BY SCHOOL TYPE TABLE 
        .   The overall passing percentage at district schools is 53.67%, and significantly higher at charter Schools, 90.5%.
    CONCLUSION 
        The district school system must be reconsidered. District schools should also examine the practices of charter schools to identify successful strategies that can be implemented to enhance student performance in district schools.
 
MATH VS READING 
TREND 2
Students tend to perform better in reading than in math.
    ANALYSIS OF TOTAL MATH AND READING SCORES
        .   Math: The Average Total Math Score is 78.98 and Approximately 74.98% of students passed math.
        .   Reading: The Average Total Reading Score is 81.87 while 85.91% of students passed reading.          
    ANALYSIS OF THE SCORES BY SCHOOL TYPE TABLE
        .   Looking at district schools, there is an apparent gap of 14.25% between the percentage of students passing Math, 66.54%, and those passing reading at 80.79%.
        .   However, in charter schools, the math passing rate is 93.62% while English, 96.58%, with a  significantly lower gap of 2.96%
    CONCLUSION
        This gap suggests that, on average, students are more successful in reading than in math, which could point to differences in teaching methods, curriculum design, or resources allocated to each subject.

SPENDING VS PERFORMANCE
Trend 3
The higher the spending, the lower the results. High passing rates are achievable with smaller budgets per student.
    ANALYSIS OF THE TOP 5 AND BASE 5 SCHOOLS
        .   For the Bottom 5 schools (all district) budgets range between $1,884,411 and $3,094,650, with per student budgets ranging between $637 and $655. 
        .   On the other hand, the top 5 schools in terms of overall passing rates (all charter) have significantly lower budgets, ranging between $585,858 to $1,319,574 and $576 and $638 per capita.
    ANALYSIS OF SCHOOL SPENDING DATA    
        .   Schools with lower spending per student (below $585) show higher passing rates, with some schools reaching an overall passing rate of 90%.
        .   Schools with higher spending per student (between $630 and $654) display significantly lower results with an overall passing rate of just 53.52%.
    CONCLUSION 
        The success of charter schools despite lower budgets indicates that efficient resource allocation and effective school management may play significant roles in their success. This inverse relationship suggests that the amounts spent per student do not necessarily correlate with higher performance. In fact, lower-cost schools tend to perform better overall, which raises questions about whether financial resources are being allocated effectively.
 
SCHOOL SIZE AND PERFORMANCE
Trend 4 
School size matters. Small and medium sized schools (mainly charter) significantly outperform larger schools (mainly districts)
    ANALYZING OVERALL PASSING PERCENTAGE PER SCHOOL SIZE
    .   Larger schools (with 2000 to 5000 students) have an overall passing rate of 58.28%.
    .   Smaller schools (with fewer than 1000 students) show a passing rate of 89.88%.
    .   Medium-sized schools (with 1000-2000 students) have a passing rate of 90.62%.
    ANALYSIS OF TOP 5 AND BOTTOM 5 SCHOOL DATA
    .   The base 5 schools (all districts) are also all Large schools, with sizes ranging between 2917 to 4635 students.
    .   The Top 5 schools (all charter) are predominantly small or medium schools, with sizes ranging between 962 and 2283.
CONCLUSION
    The relationship between school size and performance indicates that larger schools may struggle to provide adequate attention to each student despite having larger budgets. Smaller and medium schools outperform larger ones, which suggests that more personalized attention to students is needed to achieve higher passing rates.
 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND AREAS OF FURTHER RESEARCH
1- FOCUS ON BUDGET EFFICIENCY
    .   Build New Schools: Rather than increasing the budgets of underperforming district schools, consider building new schools to reduce overcrowding and allow for more individualized attention. The high budgets allocated to district schools, which exceed those of charter schools, could be better spent on creating additional smaller schools.
    .   Investigate Fund Allocation and Possible Corruption: Examine how budgets are managed in district schools and evaluate the efficiency of financial resource allocation.
    .   Improve Management: I suggest district schools reimagine their funding system by looking into how charter schools are managed for guidance. The changes could include granting localized management more autonomy. I also suggest hiring managerial staff with previous experience running charter schools.
2- REASSES MATH CURRICULUM
    .   The outstanding low performance in Math across these larger schools suggests that students may not be receiving the support they need to succeed, despite higher budgets.
    .   Curriculum Change: District schools should reconsider their standardized math curriculum by first examining why charter school math programs are successful and adapting those strategies. Refining the curriculum could involve offering more flexibility in implementation and teaching methods, along with increased individualized attention for students. Additionally, hiring math teachers with experience in charter schools could bring valuable insights and expertise to improve outcomes.
3- IMPROVE CLASSROOM SIZE AND TEACHER SUPPORT
    .   In addition to building new schools, classroom size and student-to-teacher ratios are likely key factors influencing these results. Reducing class sizes to improve these ratios could lead to better outcomes in both math and reading scores. I recommend further investigation into classroom sizes and student-to-teacher ratios, as they appear to be crucial factors for student success.
